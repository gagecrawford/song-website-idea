# song-website-idea
A song library website where song information can be added and removed.
Started out as an example of "Project: Library" from Cat Queen on The Odin Project(https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library), was then modified into a song library.
